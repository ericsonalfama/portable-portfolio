## Gombo
Gombo is an educational application that digitizes and improves the agricultural notebook. With Gombo, managing your farm will be easier, as its collection notebook is more intuitive. For this application, I chose to develop it on the no-code Adalo platform. In addition, MongoDB and Node.js were used to develop the backend.
